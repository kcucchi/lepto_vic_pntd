Analysis of environmental determinants of leptospirosis in Sichuan, China

This code supported the analysis of a medical geospatial dataset, leveraging the large-scale hydroclimatic model VIC as well as distributed-lags gam regression models.

Results supports the hypothesis that precipitation effects are mediated through soil moisture. Soils may serve as an environmental reservoir and may play a significant yet underrecognized role in leptospirosis transmission.
